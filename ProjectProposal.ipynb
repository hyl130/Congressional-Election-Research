    "For the 2020 presidential election, we saw the defeat of Donald Trump in the election, and up to his loss, we could see a down trend in his approval rate and popularity[^one]. President Trump left his position with the lowest approval rate in history[^two]. This situation begs the question of the correlation between a president’s approval rate and the number of seats their party wins or loses in an election. During each election, the position of each state has been mostly determined due to the party demographic of their population[^three]. However, swing states are much more different due to the volatility of their position for each election, and because of that, they are ever more important during the election process[^four]. The past presidential election also saw an unprecedented shift in the political party of many historically safe states, while some key battleground states made increasingly decisive moves towards one color, suggesting that the political preferences of the electoral map may be shifting[^five]. Future elections may become much more volatile and competitive as it becomes more difficult to predict the election outcomes in pivotal states. Thus, we would like to conduct a deep analysis between the approval rate in swing states and whether the seats gained or lost as a result of the election. \n",

    "For certain districts with minor populations, the demographic results could possibly lose the anonymity of the voters. \n",
    "A prediction on who will win an election can affect how the voters vote, as there is a tendency for voters to vote for who they think will win. \n",
    "We expect our dataset to be reliable and credible because it is from federal and state government sources. However, data presidential approval ratings may be skewed because it only represents those people who respond to the polls, which usually consists of a more opinionated population. Furthermore, presidential approval ratings are typically gathered and released publicly for the media by news corporations and polling organizations. The political affiliation of these organizations, as well as the sampled group (gender, age, socioeconomic status, education level, ethnicity), and sampling method may lead to different types of bias in the approval ratings. Since data collection has evolved over time due to advances in technology, the long term gradual trends in the data over time may also reflect potential inaccuracies. \n",
    "In addition, since our project focuses on looking at the overall trends from pre-existing datasets rather than analyzing participant data from surveys, we do not have to anonymize data by removing personally identifiable information such as names and addresses. Therefore, the privacy of the participants who comprised the survey data was handled by the sources who initially gathered the data that we used. Due to the public nature of our sources, we do not expect to face any ethical issues in putting anyone’s privacy at risk when doing the dataset analysis. \n"
